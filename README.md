# Track-User-Activity

## [Live](https://mern-realtime-chat-app.netlify.app/)

#### Introduction

This is a full-stack chat application that can be up and running with just a few steps. 
Its frontend is built with Vue 3.
The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js.
I also used BeaconAPI to send user data to the backend. and the visibilitychange  event listener to use to signal (data) the end of a user's session
