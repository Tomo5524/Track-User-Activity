# Track-User-Activity

#### Introduction

This is a full-stack user behaviour track application that can be up and running with just a few steps. 
Its frontend is built with Vue 3.
The backend is built with Express.js and Node.js.
I also used BeaconAPI to send user data to the backend in the event of visibilitychange (event listener). User behaviour also gets sent over at the end of a user's session
